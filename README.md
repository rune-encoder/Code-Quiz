# Coding Quiz

## Description

Love coding? Ready for a challenge? Try this quiz!

This webpage application was designed to be fun and help users study coding concepts.

Challenge yourself. This quiz has a built in timer. 
1. For every incorrect question you get -10 seconds removed from the timer.
2. For every correct question you get +4 added to the timer.

Once the timer reaches zero all unanswered questions count against you.


At the very end of the quiz your questions are graded and you get to record your highscores.
Your progress is saved so you get to try again.

Memorizing the order of the right or wrong choices will not help you.

## Credits

1. I do not take credit for the The Fisher-Yates shuffle function used. The function is used to shuffle the questions much like you would shuffle cards to prevent the same order.
